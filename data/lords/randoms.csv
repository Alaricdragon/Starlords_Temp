MutableStat:StatToModify

MutableStat_multi:StatToModify
notes on MutableStat, MutableStat_flat, MutableStat_multi: 
1) the 'StatToModify' is the id of the stat you are changing.
2) The 'id' is the ID of the change you are incoring. only one change of the same id is allowed per stat, but one stat can recive many diffrent changes.
3) The acseptable input data is always a Double value.
4) MutableStat_flat always acts as a flat modification to the stat.
5) MutableStat_multi always acts as a multi modification to the stat
6) MutableStat, if below 1 will act as MutableStat_multi. if higher then 1 will act as MutableStat_flat (whos value is calculated as a flat multiplication to the 'base' value of the stat. effectivly, a multiplicitive increase -without- exspenensal growth through multible interactions)","this represents the defalt value of a given stat. for randomization of starlords data
LinkedObject is: ????","starlords will only remember the item with the highest 'loadPriority' for each id + Type
