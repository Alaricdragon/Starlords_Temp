"#please note: for DataTypes of 'MutibleStat', the ID is organized as 'MUTIBLE_STAT_ID:THIS_ITEM_ID'. were MUTIBLE_STAT_ID is the ID of the stat you with to malipulate.","what this random will apply to
possabilitys:
LORD
FACTION
PMC (not yet implemented)","This represents the possable data being stored here.
possabilitys are:
Boolean
Double
String
Object
MutableStat
MutableStat_flat
MutableStat_multi
notes on MutableStat, MutableStat_flat, MutableStat_multi: 
1) The acseptable input data is always a Double value.
2) MutableStat_flat always acts as a flat modification to the stat.
3) MutableStat_multi always acts as a multi modification to the stat
4) MutableStat, if below 1 will act as MutableStat_multi. if higher then 1 will act as MutableStat_flat (whos value is calculated as a flat multiplication to the 'base' value of the stat. effectivly, a multiplicitive increase -without- exspenensal growth through multible interactions)","this represents the defalt value of a given stat. for randomization of starlords data
LinkedObject is: ????","This is the value this stat will be attacked to the player, be it the player faction, player PMC, or player lord. if unset, will use the 'value' as normal","starlords will only remember the item with the highest 'loadPriority' for each id + Type
type: double
linkedObject: null"
