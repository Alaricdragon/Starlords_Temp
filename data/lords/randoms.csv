PMC (not yet implemented)","This represents the data transoformation happing for this random.
example: ~starlords/util/memoryUtils/Compressed/hTypes/MemCompressed_R_Double_Base can override a double value
For example: WEIGHTED_RANDOM:DOUBLE would turn a weighted random into a dobule.
'Value' should have the current input poncuation for each Data Type.
Data Types are:
doubles:
DOUBLE			a number value
RANDOM:DOUBLE		a random value between a min and max value. should look like:
	min:double
	max:double	
RANDOM_LIST:DOUBLE	a list of values and there odds. should look like:
	value:odds
	value:odds
	value:odds
	...
WEIGHTED_RANDOM:DOUBLE	a weighted random equadtion should look like: 'max:min:target:standard deviation' were:
	max: the max value of this random.
	min: the min value of this random.
	target: the target value of this random.
	standard deviation: the standard deviation of this random (in effect, 64.2% of items are withen 1 sd of the target. 27.2% of items are between 1 and 2 sd, and 4.2% of items are between 2 and 3 sd)

Strings:
STRING			a string
RANDOM_LIST:STRING	a list of values and there odds. should look like:
	value:odds
	value:odds
	value:odds
	...

Booleans:
BOOLEAN			a true / false value
RANDOM:BOOLEAN		a double value between 0 and 1. if a randomly chosen value is less then this, returns true

Other:
OTHER: this is a link to some random item. should always link to a 'MemCompressed_R_Object_Base'. usefull for storing more complecated varubles and objects","this represents the defalt value of a given stat. for randomization of starlords data
what is stored here depends on what is in the DataType section. please see that for details on this structure.
please note that it is possable to replace -any value- with a script. any time a given peace of data calls for a value, one can replace it with a class by changing the value to:
~classPath. the following values can be represented by the following classes:
double: MemCompressed_R_Double_Base
boolean:MemCompressed_R_Boolean_Base
String: MemCompressed_R_String_Base
Object: MemCompressed_R_Object_Base

example:
~src/thingy/overwritenDoubleBase could replace a double for within a given value"
