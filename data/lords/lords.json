Tutored by the last survivors of the First AI War, Wallis embodies hegemony military tradition that stretches back for over a century. Though overshadowed by Andrada in his early years, Wallis rose to prominence following Andrada's betrayal. Choosing to remain loyal to the hegemony, he sought to rebuild a grand fleet to restore the Hegemony's prestige. He served with distinction in the Second AI War against both Persean and Tri-Tachyon forces. Wallis finetuned and perfected the Hegemony's core line-of-battle doctrine. In order to combat the AI threat, Wallis' men became machines unto themselves, following orders with mechanical precision and disregard for their individual lives. As the backbone of the hegemony's forces, Wallis soon gained the nickname \"The Great\", and his fleet was accordingly called The Great Wall. After the war, the High Hegemon himself became wary of Wallis' popularity. Fearing a second Andrada situation, Wallis was passed over as First Star Lord and sent to the outskirts to guard Nachiketa, which he has contented himself to until this day.",

In reality, he prefers to delegate everyday affairs to his capable SVPs of Research and Engineering. It is no secret that Askia is a puppet of CEO Sun, appointed to his position following Sun's ouster and return in order to ensure that she was never couped again. His exact connection with the CEO is unknown, but he is unquestionably loyal and entrusted as head of Tri-Tachyon's secret police. A shadowy organization with no formal corporate structure, the secret police was founded as a spy agency for corporate espionage. However, under Askia's direction its role has expanded to include surveillance of Sun's opposition. It is rumored that Sun uses the agency to conduct blackmail and outright assassination of her critics, though nothing has been definitively linked to her. Askia and his fellow operatives field a fleet consisting of solely phase ships, the ideal ships for them to carry out their clandestine missions.",

Hierax could be considered the primary architect behind the company's cutthroat political culture. By forcing departments to directly compete for funding, he aims to create an environment where incompetence would be out-competed and weeded out, thus raising the bar continually. Hierax also introduced several subjective criteria into funding decisions in order to increase his own standing within the company, as SVPs are forced to curry favor with him personally. Hierax's wealth and influence are immense. His fleet is a tour de force of Tri-Tachyon engineering, containing all of its most feared frigate designs. However, without any of the more plain line-holding designs, his forces prefer quick skirmishes and lack staying power in prolonged engagements.",

As Head of Research, Taiho cares little for both military affairs and corporate politics, an attitude which has alienated her from most other executives.

It's rumored that Taiho successfully reverse-engineered autonomous ship designs employed during the First AI War, though the PR department of Tri-Tachyon vehemently denied that such experiments ever took place.

Before long, little trace remained of the once-charismatic salesman. Carnegie took a special interest in the Hyperion, claiming that it reminded him of his attitude in his days as an underdog. With his outrageous wealth, he is able to afford the largest Hyperion fleet in the sector, along with a host of Tri-Tachyon's other white elephant designs.

As such, Vauban holds a key role in the megacorporation's fleet, acting as the anvil to the others' hammers. The Tri-Tachyon defense department is traditionally based in Skathi, where constant border skirmishes with the Hegemony lead to a steady supply of battle-hardened pilots. Vauban was a secondary co-conspirator in the plot to overthrow CEO Sun during the Second AI War. When their plan backfired, Artemesia purged his entire faction from the company, yet Vauban's participation was discreetly ignored and wiped from the record. With this move, Artemesia quietly confirmed Vauban's irreplaceability in times of war. Other executives may follow their own whimsy, but Vauban and his paragons will always be Tri Tachyon's unbreakable line of defense.",
