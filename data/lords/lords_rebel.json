Garibaldi's host welcomes without question all kinds of criminals, refugees, and other people wanted by the major powers of the sector. However, once they've joined, recruits are subject to a strict set of laws known as the Brynhild code. These laws include restrictions on raiding civilian transports, rules of conduct in battle and trade negotiations, communal loot sharing, and other provisions which have led the citizenry to view Garibaldi as a modern-day Robin Hood. Violations are punished severely, and most offenders are executed by Garibaldi herself. The core Garibaldi fleet consists of men and women who cherish their second opportunity to live a principled life, and newcomers who disagree learn quickly to adapt or otherwise do not last long. Together, they fight with fervor to protect their way of life and prove that there may yet be honor among thieves.",

When Augustus came of age, he fled from Fikenhild and arrived in Chalcedon, where he joined a local pather squadron.

Given the high attrition in most pather fleets, Augustus was able to quickly move up the open ranks and eventually became leader of his entire pather cell.

Their tension came to a head during a skirmish with Tri-Tachyon where Hamilton's forces acted as vanguard. When the main Hegemony fleet arrived, they opened fire indiscriminately on all combatants, resulting in a bloody three-way brawl where Hamilton's squadron was almost completely annihilated. Hamilton was recalled to Gilead, where he learned that the Church had covered up the incident to preserve goodwill with the Hegemony. Hamilton resigned from his position and resurfaced a year later in Chalcedon as a converted pather. With his experience as a Knight, he has specially engineered nearly his entire fleet with safety overrides to better rush his Hegemony foes and right the wrongs of the past.",
