V0.3.37:
    new:
        changed the way starlords handle dialog. although there is not mush new yet (some escape hotkeys keys, a very small number of fixed dialog, bribing a starlord will give that starlord wealth), and its not 100% done (yet), it lays (most) of the ground work for furture upgrades, as well as allows players to build completely custom dialog for each and every starlord, should they so chose.
        I have been working on this since the last day of april. I thought it would take a week. there are like, 200 new classes just to handle what I did. im never saying 'oh it will just take a week' again.
        please report any dialog bugs to me. I will fix them as soon as possable.

        (hopefully) fixed a issue were starlords in the faction the player is commonsense in declares war / peace with someone, and the player is not dragged into the conflict

        Prison Break - An imprisoned lord will request that you defeat their captor in exchange for defection

        fixed lords AI breaking at random when a fleets containing location is null.
V0.3.22:
    fixes:
        added some random crash protection to the LordStrategicModule. this should prevent crashes when a lord's 'getContainingLocation' is null.

V0.3.21:
    NOT save compatible with any older version
    fixes:
        added a additional layer of protection to the LordEvent .getFaction function. it should be more robust now.

    added crash protection to the raiding function.
V0.3.19:
    fixed a crash related to failing to get certain text parameters in lord dialog.

V0.3.16:

    improved some logs for easier debugging

    new:
        added a setting in the one new game lord generator that caps the max number of lords generated at game start.
            -this is enabled by default. the default value is 1k starlords.
    fixes:
        (hopefully) fixed starlords being able/unable to attack / invaded worlds and factions they should not/should have been able to.
        (hopefully) fixed starlords being able to decalre war / make peace with factions they should not have had the capacity to do so.
        (hopefully) fixed lords from minor factions (like pirates) from spawning with fiefs at new game (yes, it was a bug)
    internal:
        moved the location of the lord tag that dictates if a starlord is immortal over to the LordTags class.
        new functions:
