V0.3.6:
    randomly fixed a issue that could rarely happen when a faction was completely destroyed, and would cause crashes do to a lack of respawn points
V0.3.5:
    added a temp version file, because its really hard to tell whenever I ad a fix into my branch of starlords.
    fixes:
        fixed the java version of this mod to only require java 8. so hopefully that helps everyone?
