requirements:
    1) upgrade update
    2) AI improvements
    3) ?Weapons Of Wonder.

someone brought up the idea of lords 'salvaging' ships from the battlefield.
its a interesting idea. even if they would just sell them.
Weapons Of Wonder requirement is because lords of the overlap in systems (a lot of salvage could be 'weapons of wonder').

so what is salvage?
mostly, its ships. ships salvaged for combat.

lords would salvage ships under the following conditions:
    1: its a variant the lord uses OR the lord really needs a ship (or its a valid Wonder)
    2: they have the supply's and fuel to handle the ship repair (and travel)
       -if a lord does not have enough supplies, they may mothball the ship.
    3: the ship is of 'high value' and they plan on selling it.

salvaged ships would:
    a: be mothballed in the fleet.
    b: be slowly repaired in the fleet, for use in combat.

when would I salvage:
    a: after battles
    b: if preforming the AI action salvage
        an AI action to help clean up all the salvage, generating credits, supplies, and fuel
        this would target any ship, but prefer known 'wonders'.
        This AI act would be more commonly done by lords that are very weak and cannot fight (when no good trade is available.)
