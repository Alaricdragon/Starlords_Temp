requirements:
    1) dialog update.

so... duels and contests.
basically, an expansion on the turnament system? or maybe I should view it differently.

I don't want to complete this right now, but a 'duel' would be a one on one fight or other action between a lord and a lord.

a 'contest' is like a tournament. something between many lords.

'duels' would happen over honor, to clear vengeance, or for fun.

a 'contest' requires some type of gathering, and is then run.


duels and contests would have there own CSV file. showing how they work when they are invoked.
baicly letting systems work smover.

note: this should probably be in structure. this feels more like structure.
