PMCs have there own resorces system. this is consisting of 4 resources:
1) Production (this represents the value of ships a PMC can produce at a given moment.)
2) Officers (this represents the number of officers that are willing to work for this PMC).
3) Specialists (this represents the number of Smods this PMC can add)
4) AI cores (this represents the number of AI cores this pmc can add to fleets) (most PMCS will keep this hidden, as most will not use AI cores).
5) troops (this represents the number of ground forces available to the PMC)
6) credits: this is the 'floaty' resorse. 'credits' are only used to trade.

for mission rewords, a PMC can give a lord things from this.
if the leader of the PMC, you can use this at will?
    -small PMCs should not beable to get lots of this, so it will never be a player bonus.

as for how PMC resources are generated? from markets. different commodity's count to different things.
resource                    commodity
Production:                 hulls X10 Military bases  (phq = X5*size, MB = X10*size, HC = X15*size)
Officers:                   crew X1 & marines X2
Specialists:                crew X2 & marines X1
AI Cores:                   ---
Troops:                     marines X1 & heavy weapons X3
Credits:                    all other commodity's are used as 'credits'. (based on market value compaired to market share)? maybe something else


every month, a number of resources will be generated, equal to R_Speed * (commoditys * mutli)

raiding:
when raiding a market, a lord gains an amount of resources from the market. this number will not be added to the PMC the market belongs to.
the lord can keep some of the resources, but is forced to give some to the PMC (depending on faction laws).

trade:
a PMC can trade for resources. all resources have a 'demand' and 'supply' on the global market, depending on how many are 'demanded' by a pmc, and how many are being 'sold' by a PMC.
this allows them to supply themselfs with resorces, even if they dont have acsess. a PMC with no um....
I messed up. everything comes from crew, marines, and hulls. I need more commodity's that do things.
