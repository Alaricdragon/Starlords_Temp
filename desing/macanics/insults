ahh insults. a important part of any conversation.

insults will be split into 3 category:
    'petty' insults:
        'you are ugly'
        'Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries!'
        'I fight oh so mush better then you'
        'bla bla bla. just be quite already'
    'real' insults:
        'real' insults will be based on 'real' actions. this means that to get a givin insult, the lord must have done something to you. examples include:
            -defeating you in a campaign
            -defeating you in a tournament
            -raiding your trade convoys
            -beating your friend / ally in a fight.
            -wining a duel over you.
            -raiding / attacking your markets successfully
    'insults by action':
        this is when a lord does something to piss you off. delibritly.
        I will need some time to think of this.

when a lord insults you, you can respond as the following:
    indifferently
    returning a insult (as a pety one, or as a 'real' one)
    dispute a insult (by pointing out victory's you had over them, or how that insult is meaning less)
    duels or combat?

insults are only really done when a lord is seeking vengeance against you. for example, by attacking you.
or raiding your markets. things like that.
basically, its a modification to 'vengeance' dialog that lets a lord really let you know how they feel.
