structure:
    1) dialog:
        -I am currently working on this.
    2) fav item support:
        -is this reuqired? like... one can do this from the dialog.json.
    3) lords Json file:
        3.0) add the ability to add tags the starlord person. tags can do interesting things:
            -) (done) "STARLORD_IMMORTAL" prevents starlords from dieing when life and death is enabled
            -) "STARLORD_LOYAL_PERMA" prevents a starlord from ever defecting from there faction for any reason.
            -) "STARLORD_LOYAL_UNTIL_DEATH" prevents a starlord from defecting until there faction is completely destroyed (has no markets)
            -) "STARLORD_LOYAL_UNTIL_FIEF" prevents a starlord from defecting until they aquire there first feif. when that happens, this tag is removed, and the starlord will act normally.
            -) "STARLORD_LOYAL_PLAYER_CAN_TURN" overrides other LOYAL tags, to allow the player to convince the starlord to join you.
        3.1) add the ability to have a overriding faction. this overriding faction will be the faction the lord draws on when it wants to add a officer to there fleet.
        3.2) add the ability to override the ratio of AI-cores on automated ships.
            -) also add the ability to have difffrent AI cores on your ships. how could I do that? I dont know.
        3.3) allow a option to have a raito of upgrades to new ships.
            -) like, weather the lord will chose to upgrade there ships with Smods first, or something else first.
    4) add the ability to have custom AI cores be used as officers for automated ships how this would work is unknown
    5) allow a starlords data to be changed -after- starlord creation.
        5.0) so, first I require 2 classes stored in the starlord: the main -lord template- and the overriding data.
             the 'overriding data' will only save the things that are diffrent about this starlord from the template (so if I changed the flagship, that would be saved).
             then when starlords is loaded, and any data from the template is checked, it will first check the overriding template for a change, then the base template for the normal data.
             the reason for doing it this way is to allow someone to change there starlord with the json file, provided that bit of data has not been changed with code.
        5.1) I will also need to set the data in the lord Template to public.
        5.2) I will need addons in the dialog that set / change data in the lords lord template.
    6) add in a 'promote officer' listener. this would allow for the following data to be overwriten on features.1
        -) the default lord fleet name
        -) the available flagships for the lord
        -) the available ships and blueprints available for the lords fleet
        -) the ability to prevent you from changing the lords fleet name, flagship, or available ships / smods.
        -) the ability to set other data, like lord personality, or skills, or so on.
    7) allow custom code that allows a modder to change the possibility for lord upgrades.
        -) right now, there are 2 upgrade paths. new ships, and s-mods.
        -) other options I know of: 'exotic technologys' mod. but that's not for me to try. just create the framework
    8) change the way 'LordAI.chooseAssignment, LordAI.beginAssignment, LordAI.progressAssignment' works. make this have a system that's highly modifiable.
        -) the best way to handle this, were to have a class that handles a given lord behaver. it would hold classes to determin when the lord changes job, and what the lord does.
        -) this would be a titen of a task. I will need to do it though.
    10) intil plugins:
        a contrubuter suggested some changed here. they are quite powerfull. need this arg.
features:
    1) allow the player to promote a officer into a starlord. when promoting the starlord, you should have the following options:
        -) requires structure.6, and structure.3.0 "STARLORD_LOYAL_UNTIL_FIEF"
        1.0) the lords fleet name
        1.1) the lords flagship (you should be able to give your lord a flagship from you ship)
            -) when doing this, the lords SMods for the flagship will be based off the Smods on the ship.
            -) if you dont have the blueprint for this ship, the ship is marked as un-recoverable permanently. this allows you to give the lord a crazy OP one of a kind flagship (this should be a option as well)
        1.2) for ships, its more complicated. first, you should be able to select a ship form your blueprints (or inputted though a listener).
             next, you should be able to refit the blueprinted ships. (using only available weapons / wings / hullmods). also, if you add S-Mods, the S-Mods will be added to the lords fleet Smods thing, but -only- for that ship variant.
             lastly, you will be able to set the ratio of each individual variant.
            -) there should be a option to allow the lord to pick there own ships (using the starlords generator).
        1.3) lord personality should be chosen randomly.
        1.4) all other lord data should just be based on the officer.
        1.5) allow the ability to set any other bit of data onto the starlord. (like custom dialog, or tags, or what have you)
        1.6) allow you to give a certain budget of credits to the starlord to create there ships / officers / S-Mods with.
        1.7) the default lord tag should be "STARLORD_LOYAL_UNTIL_FIEF". this is because the starlord has not yet had a tast of -power-, so they will be loyal until they aquire something. even if your faction is wiped out.
        1.8) lastly, this should cost a number of story points, and this value should increase for every starlord you create, up to a limit. this prevents you from creating 1000 starlords and taking over everything.
    2) allow starlords to defect to the player faction. this involves a few changes
        2.0) first, starlords that want to join the player faction need to be tagged. well tagged, they cant leave there faction. the tag should expire after 1 month.
        2.1) a intel should be added, were it will then open the lords dialog, with a custom greeting, and options related to defection.
        2.2) if you encounter the starlord somewhere, it should also open this greeting dialog. if you encounter the lord in the wild, the option to talk to them should be glowing yellow like whenever someone wants to talk to you.
    3) allow starlords to be captures, if there flagship dies and the starlord retreats (losses the battle)
        -) (thanks Aleksandros for the code!)
        3.0) code:
            if (!lord.isPlayer())
            {
            if (loser.getFlagship() == null)
            {
            log.info("[StarLords] Lord " + lord.getLordAPI().getNameString() + " lost his flagship. Marked for capture.");
            maybeCaptured.add(lord);
            }
            else
            {
            if (loser.getFlagship().isFlagship() == false)
            {
            log.info("[StarLords] Lord " + lord.getLordAPI().getNameString() + " lost his flagship. Marked for capture.");
            maybeCaptured.add(lord);
            }
            }
            }
    4) the ability for lords/player to place bountys on other lords (or the player). this is a complicated task:
        -) requires structure.8
        -) it might be required to change the relations from matching relation amount between lords, but instead allow lords to have different feelings to eachother. this should allow a lord to pick on one a lot without developing hate of its target (instead, only the target will get angry over the bullying)
        -) so, in theory it would be simple to just have the lord place a bounty on people they don't like (provided they have enough ships). so here are the steps I have came up with:
        4.0) first, create a new item in the relation controlar. something like... 'anger'.
            -) the lords 'anger' to a lord will change at the same time as any relation change. (2X relation change?)
            -) every month, the lords 'anger' will move by one ponit tords whatever the lords relations are.
                -) I could make this calculation only run whenever the lord look at how angry they are. this is important, because there are starlords^2 anger variables required.
        4.1) lords, at random can attempt to place a bounty on the starlord they are most angry at. (provided they have a minimum anger level, adn a min amount of exstra credits?) doing so will massively reduce 'anger'. but will slightly reduce relations between the starlords.
        4.2) lords at peace can attempt to hunt down bounty targets (provided they are at war? or maybe allow certen personalitys / factions to hunt down lords regardless, or even same faction lords)?
            -) if sucsesfull, the lords will all gain the amount of credits equal to the bounty devided between them
            -) if the player joins, the players proton of the bounty is devided by normal rules.
        4.3) if a lord is defeated with a bounty on them, the bounty will vanish, and the lords relation with anyone who placed the bounty on them will be reduced.
             lords that placed the bounty on a lord should also gain relation between eachother? (but only a small amount)?
             lords that take down a bounty will gain relation with the ones who placed the bounty (between 1 and 10, depending on the amount of credits each lord placed.)
             lords that fight together to take down a bounty target will gain relation between themselves.
        4.4) if a lord dies with a bounty on them, the credits will be refunded.
        4.5) if a lord dies after placing a bounty, the bounty will remain for a time, before vanishing.
        4.6) if a lord develops a negitive amount of anger on a starlord they have placed a bounty on, they may withdraw a bouty.
            -) at this time, that part of the bounty will become timed.
        4.7) there should be a custom intil plugin showing not who is placing the bountys, so you can see when each amount of credits is going to time out (if they are).
        4.8) a custom intill plugin will be needed for when the player has a bounty on them.
        4.9) the lords should not just know were a bounty target is. (if the lord leaves civilized space). so a player running away might be able to wait out there bounty.
    5) the ability to talk to officers (using the lord dialog system I am building)
        -) VN sector when???? (for real though, we are so close to VN sector at this point. like, we can already romance for gods sake!)
misc improvements:
    1) s-mod improvements:
        1.0) I want to go into the SMods.json and add a bunch of Smod possabilitys
        1.1) I need to add additional rules for the Smods. rules I have thought of are the following:
            -) wepon mount types, and sizes
            -) shiled arc, spead, efisahncy, so on
            -) active wepons with ammo.
    2) exstra lords:
        2.0) add a option that allow the exstra lord generator to remove lords from the game, provided its higher then the wanted amount of starlords.
    3) life and death
        3.0) add a option that makes it so lords present at game start (or from the json file) cannot die.
    4) player owned fiefs:
        4.0) ether let the player do things like create garasons, and get income, or even let the player act as the govern of the world.
settings:
    1) lord fleet settings
        1.0) max fleet size (DP)
        1.1) max fleet size (ships)
        1.2) max number of officers
        1.3) max officer level?
        1.4) max number of ships of each type?
        1.5) fleet cost settings (cost multi of Smods, cost muti of ships)
    2) politics settings
        2.0) set time that consul stay in session
        2.1) set the time between consul sessions.
    3) life and death system:
        3.0) make it so the player spouse can have different death chance
