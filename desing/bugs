NOTE: I forgot to record the original list, so there are some bugs missing from this.
1) starlord AI:
    a) starlords will sometimes charge straight to there death when fighting other starlords.
    b) starlords fleet can be set to some random fleet at a random location. the process of this happing is completely unknown.
           -currently, as a temp fix, 'AlexRednicon' put this in the Lords Straticic Moduel
               if (lord.getFleet().getContainingLocation() == null){
                   for (CampaignFleetAPI fleet : Misc.getNearbyFleets(other, 600)){
                       if (lord.getFleet().getCommander() == fleet.getCommander()){
                           lord.getLordAPI().setFleet(fleet);
                       }
                   }
               }
           HOWEVER: this fix needs to be applyed to the fleet 100% of the time somehow...? (does this even effect fleeets all the time?)
    c) starlords are always attacking in colonly crises buildup.
           -I need to change this so they only attack when the crisis fleet is coming.
           -it would be better if I could do it so the lords fleets came at the same time as the crises fleet.
    d) Utils.canBeAttacked(MarketAPI)
        d.0) needs to ignore nexerlin outposts (dont look at markets less then size 3)?
        d.1) needs to ignore markets with no industrys (another issue to fix)
2) tornaments:
    a) with Aod QoL instaled, you cant fight in tornaments hosted by your own faction
    b) possible tournament ships include things like station and ship moduels.
    c) if you fly your own ship, it will remove the officer from that ship when the tornament ends.
    d) sometimes doing a tournament will drain all your ships CR. this seems to be fixed after combat. this should be improved somehow.
3) generator:
    a) a lords fav item needs to be limited to the available fav items
    b) lords seem to be using ships not part of the main faction blueprints a lot. this should be fixed?
    c) on game start, with exstra lords for all faction on, it seems to create to many starlords? (needs testing)
    d) life and death system seems to create starlords to fast. I will need to look into this.
4) life and death system:
    a) a lords / players spouse needs to be unset when there partner dies.
