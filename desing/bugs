NOTE: I forgot to record the original list, so there are some bugs missing from this.
1) starlord AI:
    a) starlords will sometimes charge straight to there death when fighting other starlords.
    b) starlords fleet can be set to some random fleet at a random location. the process of this happing is completely unknown.
           -currently, as a temp fix, 'AlexRednicon' put this in the Lords Straticic Moduel
               if (lord.getFleet().getContainingLocation() == null){
                   for (CampaignFleetAPI fleet : Misc.getNearbyFleets(other, 600)){
                       if (lord.getFleet().getCommander() == fleet.getCommander()){
                           lord.getLordAPI().setFleet(fleet);
                       }
                   }
               }
           HOWEVER: this fix needs to be applyed to the fleet 100% of the time somehow...? (does this even effect fleeets all the time?)
    c) starlords are always attacking in colonly crises buildup.
           -I need to change this so they only attack when the crisis fleet is coming.
           -it would be better if I could do it so the lords fleets came at the same time as the crises fleet.
    d) Utils.canBeAttacked(MarketAPI)
        d.0) needs to ignore nexerlin outposts (dont look at markets less then size 3)?
        d.1) needs to ignore markets with no industrys (another issue to fix)
        d.2) when core worlds invasions are off (nexerlin) starlords will not respect this.
    d2) valid targets for raids, invasions, and trade need to be calculated separately
    e) starlords attending a feast will not defend there allies if they are attacked (they should protect the world, and anyone at the feast if they are attacked)
    f) starlords 100% ARE still be attacking things they should not be allowed to (dispute nexerlin settings).
    g) starlords will stand around and do nothing, iggnoring all attempts at control:
        g.0) attempt to run the following in lord AI:
            if(lord.isStuckLord){
                    lord.setCurrAction(LordAction.PATROL);
                    fleetAI.clearAssignments();
                    Misc.clearFlag(mem, MemFlags.FLEET_BUSY);
                    fleetAI.addAssignmentAtStart(FleetAssignment.PATROL_SYSTEM, null, 1000, null);
            }
            check the lord memoryFlags and compair them all?
            force the lord to run the 'chooseAssignment' function?

V0.3.38:
2) tornaments:
    a) with Aod QoL instaled, you cant fight in tornaments hosted by your own faction
    b) possible tournament ships include things like station and ship moduels.
    c) if you fly your own ship, it will remove the officer from that ship when the tornament ends.
    d) sometimes doing a tournament will drain all your ships CR. this seems to be fixed after combat. this should be improved somehow.
    e) some tournament ships can have completely broken layouts.
3) generator:
    a) a lords fav item needs to be limited to the available fav items
    b) lords seem to be using ships not part of the main faction blueprints a lot. this should be fixed?
    c) on game start, with exstra lords for all faction on, it seems to create to many starlords? (needs testing)
    d) life and death system seems to create starlords to fast. I will need to look into this.
    e) T2 and T1 starlord settings should be removed. instead, such slots should always start filled (I thought T1 and T2 were stronger starlords, not possitions on political ladder.)
4) life and death system:
    a) a lords / players spouse needs to be unset when there partner dies.
5) additional lord generator:
    a) I need to remove the T2, T1 lords from settings. T2 and T1 lords are not how powerfull the lords are, its how important the lord is to a faction.
       instead, I should just make sure each faction fills the lord slots in order of having 1 T2, and 3 T1 lords, before the rest are T0.
6) S-Mods system:
    a) (fixed)S-Mods have been reported to not be presistant between saves (the S-mods changing when rebooting starsector). I need to look into this.
    b) phase based S-mods are hopping on ships without the phase system.
    c) S-mods can be instaled even when they should be incompatible.
        -look into magiclibs??? hullmod compatibility system for help with this.
7) politics
    when starlords declare war, they sometimes... just dont care????? like, are they even at war???? (needs farther conformation)
8) garrisons:
    a) station regenerates if you destroy it, but not all the escorts
    b) ship CR is not saved between battles.
    c) you cant see all the escorts, or the difficulty rating
