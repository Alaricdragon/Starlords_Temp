dialogs right now are completely unuseable for the full fetures I want added.
solution: copy the rules.csv system. passificly the following:
1) change the system form a 'json file' to a list of CSV files.
    1.a) the 'core dialog CSV' file. this holds the following data on each line:
        1) this dialogs ID
        2) a link to the dialog.csv file that mush be used.
        3) a link to the id(s) that act as a backup to this one.
            -a 'backup' dialog runs its line provided no line with the same ID exsists in a 'higher' priority dialog.csv
            -this dialog also inharets all the 'backup' dialogs dialogs. But they act on a lower priority.
    1.b) the 'dialog' csv files. this will hold the following on each line:
        1) the line ID.
        2) the 'fire all' / 'fire best' id. runs when 'fire all' and 'fire best' are ran.
        3) the conditions to activate this line (must be true or line is not shown).
        4) lines: the lines that are activated. allows 'fire all' and 'fire best'
            -note: options only run this data when they are pressed.
        5) options: the options that are activated when this is loaded.
            -note: options only run this data when they are pressed.
        4) the scripts that are fired when the line is loaded.
            -includes fire all / fire best for options
        5) the scripts that are ran when this item is pressed (buttons only)
        6) the 'order' (order of displays)
        7) the 'fire best priority' (only used on fire best. line with the highest value wins).

2) 'fire all'
    fire all will activate everything with a certen condition attached.
    this will replace default_dialog_options
3) 'fire best'
    fires the best options, based on the 'fire best priroity'

3) keep in mind, I also want a system simaler to the 'scripts' of a givin
